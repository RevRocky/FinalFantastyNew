Some Notes about the AI System:

1) I think we need to give it a set list of meals it can make. The AI will need to know what the two known judges are and it will have to calculate the "Score" of each meal.
	Add a little bit of percentage of fuckup and roll to add some optional things. 


	So AI Calculation will be something like

	(Weighted Sum(Stats) - Possible Overpowering Mods) * Random Weight (in range .5-1) with weights encouraging the things the judges like. Meal with highest stat will be chosen by the AI. Stats for each meal

	The game will then roll a D20. If lower than 2, the meal will fail and some junk will be returned. 
	Optional ingredients will be picked from a list!
